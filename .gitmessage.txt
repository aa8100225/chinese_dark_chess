# <type>: <short summary>

# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so. The blank line separating the summary from the body
# is critical; various tools like `log`, `shortlog` and `rebase` can get
# confused if you run the two together.

# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.

# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

# - Bullet points are okay, too
#
# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
#   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
# like this:

# Resolves: #123
# See also: #456, #789

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
